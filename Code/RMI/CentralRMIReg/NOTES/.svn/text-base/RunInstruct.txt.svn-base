The purpose of this code is to show how a single RMI 
registry can be used without the need to broadcast IPs.

Basically the RMIRegistry is started, and remains operational.
The Servers connect to the RMIRegistry using the IP and Port for
	the RMIRegistry.

The Clients access the Servers by 'connecting' to the RMI registry
	(using the IP and port).



***********************************

How to operate:

1. Run rmi.RMIRegistry
2. Run rmiServer1.RMIServer_1
3. Run rmiServer2.RMIServer_2
4. Run either RMI client: rmiClient1.RMIClient_1. You will note there is output.
